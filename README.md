```
    APP_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000"
    APP_MOCK_API=false
    FIREBASE_API_KEY=""
```
4.  Start the development server using `npm run dev`
5.  Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br /> Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br /> You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br /> It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br /> Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm start`

Runs the app in production mode. Make sure to build the app before running this command.

### `npm run lint`

Runs the ES linter to check for syntax errors and coding standards. The linter will report any issues in the console.

### `npm run test`

Runs all the tests with Jest.

## Environment Variables

This project uses the following environment variables:

### `APP_API_BASE_URL`

The base URL for the API. Default value is `http://localhost:8000`.

### `APP_MOCK_API`

A boolean value that determines whether to use a mock API response. `true` is recommended to get everything running. Default value is `false`.

### `FIREBASE_API_KEY`

Set up a Firebase app/project, and paste the API key here. Firebase is used to authenticate users.

## Using Docker for local development

Docker can help you set up a consistent and isolated environment for developing your Vite React app. You can use Docker to run your app in both development and production modes using `docker-compose`. Here's how to get started:

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, you'll need to have Docker and `docker-compose` installed on your machine. You can download Docker for free from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop), and `docker-compose` is usually included with Docker.

#### Building the Docker image

```
docker-compose build

```

#### Run Docker container in Development mode

```
docker-compose up dev

```

#### Run Docker container in Production mode

```
docker-compose up prod

```
